When would you want to add a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For backup reason, to share code with remote developer, to be able to retrieve code from different computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To allow me to check changes before pulling them
